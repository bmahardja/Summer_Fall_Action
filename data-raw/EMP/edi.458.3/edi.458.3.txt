  The Interagency Ecological Program’s (IEP) Environmental Monitoring
  Program (EMP) was initiated in compliance with the Water Right
  Decision D-1379 (now mandated by Water Right Decision D-1641) and has
  monitored discrete water quality and nutrients in the upper San
  Francisco Estuary since 1975. The objectives of the EMP are to obtain
  consistent and accurate monthly data at established monitoring
  stations, provide and document information necessary to achieve
  compliance with salinity, flow, and dissolved oxygen standards, and to
  report this information for the purpose of management and conservation
  of the upper San Francisco Estuary. While the EMP also collects
  biological data, this dataset only includes the discrete water quality
  and nutrient data collected by the EMP from 1975-2019.

          (1.) Data collection methods:
          Station frequency and type:
          
  Discrete water quality monitoring stations were created in compliance
  with Water Right Decision D-1379 and are now mandated by Water Right
  Decision D-1641. Discrete water quality sampling occurs once a month
  at each monitoring station. From 1975 to 1994, however, sampling
  occurred twice a month, typically on a seasonal basis starting in
  Spring and ending in Fall. Stations that are accessed by research
  vessel (e.g., boat) are referred to as “mid-channel stations” and
  those that are accessed by vehicle (e.g., truck or van) are referred
  to as “shore-based stations”.

          Field Data:
          
  The EMP collects both surface and bottom discrete water quality field
  measurements during high slack tide using a multiparameter instrument
  (see below for models used for the duration of the sampling period).
  Surface measurements are collected one meter below the surface of the
  water and bottom measurements are collected one meter above the bottom
  of the channel. At each mid-channel station, the multiparameter
  instrument is placed over the side of the research vessel and lowered
  into the water using a winch crane. The instrument is directly
  connected to an onboard computer by a 30-meter cable. Once the
  instrument is equilibrated to the local conditions, the surface and
  bottom water quality measurements are recorded onto field data sheets,
  then the instrument is returned onboard the vessel. At shore-based
  stations, the multiparameter instrument is either placed directly in
  the water or into a bucket filled with water collected at the station.
  The surface and bottom water quality measurements are then recorded
  onto field data sheets once the instrument is equilibrated to the
  local conditions.

          
  Light extinction measurements are made by lowering a light meter into
  the water and recording depth and light measurements to establish a
  curve of light extinction. The depth at which only 1% of the surface
  light intensity remains is read from the curve and recorded. A Secchi
  disk is also used to determine water clarity and light penetration by
  lowering the disk into the water in a shaded area and recording the
  measurement when the black and white quadrants of the disk become
  indistinguishable. Visual observations of both presence and density of
  the blue-green cyanobacteria, Microcystis
  aeruginosa, are made at each station and given a
  qualitative score ranging from 1 (no Microcystis)
  to 5 (continuous colonies of Microcystis forming
  mats/scum).

          Laboratory Data:
          
  The research vessels used to collect samples from mid-channel stations
  are equipped with wet laboratories for onboard processing of water
  samples. Water is collected using a flow-through system whereby it is
  pumped into the laboratory from a fixed intake located one meter below
  the water’s surface. For shore-based stations, water is collected
  either from a Van Dorn water sampler or via a submersible pump. For
  both mid-channel and shore-based stations, water is collected into a
  churn splitter and homogenized before being dispensed into sample
  collection bottles. Samples of dissolved nutrients are filtered using
  mixed cellulose ester filters (diameter = 47 mm, pore size = 0.45 µm).
  Samples of chlorophyll a and pheophytin
  a are collected on a glass fiber filter (diameter
  = 47 mm, effective pore size = 1.0 µm). Samples of dissolved organic
  carbon are passed through glass fiber filters (diameter = 47 mm,
  effective pore size = 1.0 µm) that have been combusted for 1 hour at
  450 ºC.

          Entrapment Zone:
          
  The EMP began sampling the Entrapment Zone (EZ) stations in 1996 to
  document the environmental conditions and geographic variability of
  the low salinity zone. This zone is sampled once a month at two
  “floating” stations, which represent the upper (upstream) and lower
  (downstream) boundaries, called EZ2 and EZ6, respectively. Station EZ2
  is located where the bottom specific conductance falls within 10% of
  2,000 µS/cm and station EZ6 is located where the bottom specific
  conductance falls within 10% of 6,000 µS/cm. When dry conditions
  reduce the freshwater flows into the San Francisco Estuary, saline
  water from the Pacific Ocean intrudes further into the estuary and
  causes the low salinity zone to travel upstream where it is split by
  the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Such conditions create two
  geographically disparate low salinity zones. Under these conditions,
  the stations EZ2-SJR and EZ6-SJR are sampled in the San Joaquin River
  in addition to stations EZ2 and EZ6, which are sampled in the
  Sacramento River.

          Vessel Use:
          
  Sampling typically occurred on research vessels from the California
  Department of Water Resources or United States Bureau of Reclamation.
  From DWR, the RV San Carlos (1975-2016) and RV Sentinel (2017-2019)
  were primarily used. From USBR, RV Compliance and RV Endeavor were
  utilized when DWR vessels were unavailable.

          (3.) Instruments and equipment:
          Field Instrumentation:
          See
  IEP_EMP_DWQN_metadata_methods.pdf
          
  Light Extinction: A Whitney LMT-8A Light Meter was used to measure the
  depth at which sunlight is extinguished to 1% of surface intensity
  from 1975 – 1986.

          
  Secchi: A 20 cm inch diameter plastic disc with alternate black and
  white quadrants was used to measure water transparency from 1975 –
  2019.

          
            Microcystis aeruginosa:
  Microcystis qualitative scores were recorded
  starting in August 2015. The qualitative score is a visual observation
  ranging from (1) meaning absent, (2) low-widely scattered colonies,
  (3) Medium-adjacent colonies, (4) High-contiguous to (5) Very High-
  concentration of contiguous colonies forming mats/scum.

          
  Chlorophyll fluorescence data collected from field instrumentation
  during the period of record is not included in this data set, but is
  available upon request (email data contact).

          (4.) Analysis and methods (standard operating
  procedures):
          Laboratory Analysis Methods:
          
  Analyses were performed by CDWR’s Bryte Laboratory for most of the
  period of record. From October – December 2019, however, analyses
  (except for chlorophyll and pheophytin) were performed by Test America
  Laboratory. Copies of written standard operating procedures for all
  laboratory analysis methods are available upon request (email data
  contact).

          (5.) Project history (change in methods and
  locations):
          Stations:
          
  At the start of the program in 1975, there were 27 discrete water
  quality monitoring stations sampled monthly. These stations mostly
  remained unchanged from 1975-1994, though a small number of stations
  were added or discontinued, while others were replaced by nearby
  stations. When a station replacement occurred, an “A” was typically
  added to the end of the old station name to create the new station
  name (e.g., station C3 was replaced by the nearby station C3A). At the
  end of 1995, sampling was discontinued at 11 stations, leaving 15
  remaining stations. Beginning in 1996, EMP implemented a revised
  compliance monitoring program, which combined the water quality,
  phytoplankton, benthic, and zooplankton samplings programs previously
  undertaken by DWR/USBR and the California Department of Fish and
  Wildlife (CDFW) independently. This led to the acquisition of the CDFW
  stations NZS42, NZ032, NZ325, NZ002, and NZ004. By 2017, the station
  list had increased to 26 stations sampled monthly, with 13 of those
  included in the original station list at the start of the program.
  Most changes made to the station list over the period of record were
  to either obtain better access, maintain consistency between program
  elements, and/or to pair discrete water quality data with data from
  other elements, such as continuous water quality or zooplankton data.

          Data:
          
  In the earlier years of the program, comprehensive nutrient sampling
  occurred monthly at all stations. This continued until 1995 when six
  of the 15 stations remaining were reduced to chlorophyll
  a and pheophytin a sampling
  only. Starting in 2016, the EMP began reinstating the comprehensive
  sampling at these chlorophyll a and pheophytin
  a-only stations. By February 2017, the full suite
  of water quality analytes was collected at every station. Regarding
  field data, surface measurements were reported from the start of the
  program, but it wasn’t until 2017 (January for mid-channel stations
  and February for shore-based stations) when bottom measurements were
  reported for the first time. There was only one month during the
  entire period of record in which no data was collected at any station,
  which was in January 1980 from reasons that were undocumented.

          
  From 1975-2019, the following laboratory analytes were added to the
  sampling list: dissolved ammonia (1979), dissolved chloride (1980),
  total dissolved solids (1997), total suspended solids (1997), volatile
  suspended solids (1997), total organic carbon (2011), dissolved
  organic carbon (2011), dissolved calcium (2011), dissolved bromide
  (2019), and total alkalinity (2019). From 1975 - 2019, the following
  laboratory analytes were dropped from the sampling list: total ammonia
  (1978), total organic nitrogen (1979), and total chloride (1980).

          
  From 1975 - 2019, the following field parameters were added to the
  sampling list: wind direction (1984), field notes (1996), weather
  observations (1996), GPS coordinates for EZ stations (2004), a rating
  score for the blue-green algae, Microcystis
  aeruginosa (2015), and near bottom measurements (2017),
  dissolved oxygen in percent saturation (2019). From 1975 - 2019, the
  following field parameters were dropped from the sampling list: 1%
  light depth (1996) and wind direction (1999).

          Collection Methods:
          
  At each discrete monitoring station, the EMP collects water quality
  and biological (phytoplankton and zooplankton) samples concurrently.
  At most stations, samples for discrete water quality are collected
  prior to beginning the zooplankton sampling, which is conducted by
  towing collection nets upstream from the station at a constant
  velocity. At four stations—D28A, D26, D8, and D4—water quality samples
  were historically collected midway through the zooplankton tow.
  Results of an internal study conducted in March 2016, however, found
  no significant differences in water quality parameters at the
  beginning tow and mid-tow locations for these four stations. As a
  result, all water quality samples are now collected before beginning
  the zooplankton tow as of June 2016.

          
  Dissolved oxygen (DO) was historically measured from a Winkler
  titration method. As the ease and accuracy of electronic DO sensors
  increased, the EMP conducted an internal study to assess any potential
  differences between DO measured by a multiparameter sonde and Winkler
  titration. No significant differences were found, and the EMP
  discontinued the use of Winkler titrations in June 2016. DO is now
  measured solely using a multiparameter sonde.

          
  Sample water from shore-based stations was historically collected via
  a pump system that was permanently installed at each station. During
  prolonged droughts, however, the EMP determined that this fixed intake
  produced unreliable data when water levels were low. As a result, the
  EMP began using a Van Dorn water sampler to collect samples at these
  stations starting in May 2016.

          (6.) QA/QC:
          
  Field data sheets are error checked by hand at the end of each
  sampling run by the water quality field leads. Field data for each run
  is then entered into CDWR’s Field and Laboratory Management System
  (FLIMS) where it is housed while the laboratory data is being
  analyzed. After the laboratory data has been analyzed, it is merged
  with the field data and uploaded into the Water Data Library. Both
  field and laboratory data are then exported into an Excel file from
  the Water Data Library and verified with the field data sheets by the
  EMP quality assurance lead.

          
  Instruments used to collect and analyze water quality data are
  calibrated and maintained following the manufacturer’s guidelines. The
  multiparameter instruments are calibrated with known standards prior
  to field runs and verified with another calibrated instrument during
  sampling. After returning from the field, the instruments are checked
  with the same calibration standards to ensure the instrument held its
  calibration. Since October 2018, the EMP started assigning a drift
  rating to each sensor on the instrument based on calculations made
  from the post-field calibration check results. These ratings follow an
  acceptance criteria developed from the USGS Wagner method to validate
  the data collected in the field and are available upon request (email
  data contact).

          
  To create this data set, annual discrete water quality data files were
  exported from the CDWR’s Water Data Library (WDL) from 1975-2019 and
  then merged to create one large data set. The data was then checked
  for accuracy using the associated field data sheets as a reference.
  Blank and duplicate data was collected during this period of record,
  but was removed from this data set, as its primary use is for internal
  QA/QC checks. The EMP also conducted heavy metal and pesticide
  monitoring historically, but this data was not included in this data
  set because it was separate from the mandate.

          (7.) Contractor Information:
          
  All water quality sampling was conducted by staff from IEP’s
  Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) primarily from the California
  Department of Water Resources and the United States Bureau of
  Reclamation with assistance from the California Department of Fish and
  Wildlife.

          (8.) External review process:
          
  An IEP Project Work Team reviewed the EMP’s sampling procedures during
  2001-2002 and a summary report and recommendations was created in
  2003.
